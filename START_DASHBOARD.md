## 📈 Understanding Recommendations

### **How It Works:**

1. **User Profile Analysis**
   - Looks at user's interests and skill level
   - Finds similar users with similar patterns

2. **Content Matching**
   - Matches content tags with user interests
   - Considers difficulty level
   - Checks popularity

3. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Finds users with similar history
   - Recommends what they liked

4. **Scoring**
   - Interest alignment: 30%
   - Difficulty match: 20%
   - Popularity: 15%
   - Collaborative: 20%
   - Recency: 10%
   - Exploration: 5%

### **Reason Tags Explained:**
- `python`, `javascript`, etc. → Topic match with user interests
- `popular_with_similar_users` → Collaborative filtering signal
- `recommended_for_you` → General recommendation
